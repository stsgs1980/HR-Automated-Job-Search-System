# HH Copilot — Changelog

All notable changes to the extension are documented in this file.
Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

---

## [1.9.28.0] — 2026-06-12

### Added
- **Rule 9.5** — all project documentation MUST be in English; chat responses to the user remain in Russian. Added to AGENT_RULES.md.

### Changed
- **All documentation translated to English** — README, ARCHITECTURE, CHANGELOG, TASK-CASCADE, guides, wireframes, PUML reference, and worklog entries. UI strings visible to end users remain in Russian.

### Fixed
- **Sponsored VotD (adsrv.hh.ru)** — 3 of 14 "Vacancies of the Day" were skipped due to tracking URLs (`adsrv.hh.ru/click?meta=ENCRYPTED`) without `vacancyId`. The vacancy ID is now extracted from the numeric `id` attribute of the parent element (e.g., `id="131408939"`). Three-level extraction strategy: (1) `vacancyId` parameter in click-URL, (2) nearest link with `vacancyId=`, (3) `id` attribute of ancestor element matching `/^\d{6,12}$/`.
- All VotD elements now receive the canonical URL `https://hh.ru/vacancy/{id}` instead of the tracking URL.
- Added tests: ID extraction from parent `id`, canonical URL for VotD, adsrv.hh.ru URL parsing.

---

## [1.9.27.0] — 2026-06-12

### Fixed
- **VotD parsing (0/14)** — "Vacancy of the Day" on the hh.ru homepage returned 0 elements. Cause: VotD links are tracking URLs (`content.hh.ru/api/v1/vacancy_of_the_day/click?vacancyId=XXX`), not standard `/vacancy/XXX`. `extractVacancyId()` now recognizes `?vacancyId=NNN` in query parameters. `parseVacanciesOfTheDay()` uses `titleEl.closest('a')` to find the click-URL.
- Added 5 `extractVacancyId` tests for VotD URL patterns.
- Added 6 VotD parsing tests with realistic DOM structure.
- Test suite: 67 tests passing.

---

## [1.9.26.0] — 2026-06-12

### Added
- **Vacancy parsing on the homepage** — when opening `hh.ru/`, the extension parses two blocks: (1) recommended vacancies with `~=` word-match for `data-qa` attributes and `href` fallback; (2) "Vacancy of the Day" block via `data-qa="vacancy_of_the_day_title"` with three vacancy ID extraction strategies.
- Added `mainPage` route to `detectPageType()` for the `/` URL pattern on `hh.ru`.
- `parseVacanciesOfTheDay()` — new parser function for VotD blocks.

---

## [1.9.25.0] — 2026-06-12

### Added
- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** — the extension automatically reloads when files change during development. WebSocket server (`ws://localhost:35729`) starts via `npm run watch`. Content script listens for reload messages and calls `chrome.runtime.reload()`. Eliminates manual extension reloading during development.

---

## [1.9.24.0] — 2026-06-12

### Fixed
- **35 WCAG/typography issues** across the entire sidebar UI:
  - **Contrast**: secondary text `#71717a` → `#52525b`, placeholder `#6b7280`, disabled button `#6b7280`, tour skip `#71717a` → `#52525b`.
  - **Invalid CSS properties**: removed `role:status`, `role:alert`, `aria-live:assertive`, `tabindex:0` from CSS declarations.
  - **Focus indicators**: `:focus-visible` styles for tab buttons, toggles, vacancy items, tour buttons.
  - **Typography**: `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` on score rings, `-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased`.
  - **ARIA attributes**: `role="status"` + `<span class="sr-only">` on spinner, `role="switch"` on toggle, `aria-expanded`/`aria-controls` on timeline toggles, `role="radiogroup"` on stats period, `role="article"` + `aria-label` on vacancy items, `aria-label` on blacklist delete, `aria-valuenow` on range inputs, `lang="ru"` + `role="dialog"` on sidebar, `aria-hidden` on decorative dots.
  - **Keyboard navigation**: WAI-ARIA tabs with Arrow/Home/End keys, Escape closes sidebar, focus trap (Tab cycles within sidebar), focus management on open/close, Enter/Space activates vacancy links.
- Fixed tab switching bug — missing `data-tab` attribute on tab buttons.
- Fixed `&nbsp;` rendering as literal text in sidebar UI.

---

## [1.9.23.0] — 2026-06-11

### Changed
- **Anti-monolith refactoring**: split `match-scorer.js` into 4 focused modules — `match-scorer-skills.js` (skill overlap 0-40), `match-scorer-title.js` (title similarity 0-30), `match-scorer-salary.js` (salary fit 0-15), `match-scorer-experience.js` (experience match 0-15). The main `match-scorer.js` is now a thin orchestrator.
- Removed `cascade-guard` submodule (repository deleted on GitHub).

---

## [1.9.22.0] — 2026-06-11

### Added
- **Synonym skill matching** — related skills are partially accounted for in scoring. If a vacancy requires "P&L" and the resume has "sales management", the synonym group provides a partial match bonus. Synonym groups: sales, IT, marketing, HR, leadership.

---

## [1.9.21.0] — 2026-06-11

### Fixed
- **"What to improve" recommendations** — replaced the noisy "10 skills not in experience descriptions" with actionable "vacancy skills missing from resume", showing only real gaps. Created a shared utility `vacancy-skills-collector.js`.

---

## [1.9.20.0] — 2026-06-11

### Fixed
- Skip skills already included in `derivedSkills` when generating recommendations — no duplicate warnings for skills the user already has.

---

## [1.9.19.0] — 2026-06-11

### Added
- **Vacancy skill derivation from job title** — vacancy cards on the search page rarely contain `keySkills`, so `deriveVacancySkills()` extracts skills from the vacancy title via `SKILL_PATTERNS` and heuristics.
- Added sales/commercial cross-references: "коммерческ" ↔ "продаж" ↔ "менеджер по развитию".
- Added missing skills to skill-dictionary: sales strategy, LTV, ROI, sales funnel building, unit economics.
- **Experience scoring fix** — "overqualified" penalty removed. Exceeding the maximum experience is NOT a penalty on the Russian labor market. 10+ years with a "3-6 years" requirement now gives 12/15 (was 8/15).

---

## [1.9.18.0] — 2026-06-11

### Fixed
- **10 bugs from code review**: employment type parsing, work format parsing, multi-value format handling, career growth logic, false positive vague phrases, Cyrillic regex boundaries, specific uncovered skills in recommendations, tooltip for uncovered skills, tour improvements.

---

## [1.9.17.0] — 2026-06-11

### Fixed
- **Skill parser** — 5 fallback strategies when `skills-card` data-qa is absent in hh.ru DOM (Magritte redesign): skills-table, heading detection, `data-qa*="skill"` scan, Magritte tag scan.
- **Experience scoring** — parse vacancy experience string ("3-6 лет") into structured format `{min:3, max:6}`.
- **Vacancy navigation** — removed broken SPA click interception that was blocking navigation.

---

## [1.9.16.0] — 2026-06-11

### Added
- **SPA navigation** — `pushState`/`replaceState` patch in `page-world.js` (MAIN world). Interception of vacancy/resume link clicks via `pushState` instead of full page reload. `MutationObserver` with 1-second debounce automatically re-parses vacancies.

---

## [1.9.15.9] — 2026-06-11

### Added
- **Derived skills from experience** — `skill-dictionary.js` (50+ Russian skill keyword patterns) + `derive-skills.js` automatically extracts skills from work experience descriptions. Integrated into both resume parsing paths (DOM and fetch). `scoreSkills()` now uses `derivedSkills` with 70% weight.

---

## [1.9.15.6] — 2026-06-11

### Fixed
- **initPageLogic() was not being called** — replaced broken `dynamic import()` with `CustomEvent 'hh-ar-init-page-logic'` pattern. Added safety net: auto-call after 3s on vacancy pages. `initPageLogic()` made idempotent to prevent duplication.

---

## [1.9.15.5] — 2026-06-11

### Added
- **Detailed vacancy parser** — `parseVacancyDetail()` extracts all fields from `/vacancy/{id}` pages: title, company, salary, experience, description, key skills, employment type, work format.
- **Match scoring** — `calculateMatchScore(vacancy, resume)` returns `{total: 0-100, breakdown: {skills, salary, experience, position, location}}`.
- **Vacancy storage** — `storage-vacancies.js` persists vacancy data between sessions.

---

## [1.9.14] — 2026-06-11

### Added
- **"Resume Assessment" block** in the Resume tab — objective assessment of completion quality:
  - Ring chart with % (color: green ≥70%, amber ≥40%, red <40%)
  - Checklist of 11 criteria with weights: position, name, salary, city, contacts, skills (3+), experience (1+), education, languages, about me, employment/format
  - Hint depending on percentage

### Changed
- **"Skill Match" block moved from Resume tab to Vacancies tab** — skills vs. vacancies analysis makes more sense tied to vacancies rather than resume
- Renamed: "Skill Analysis" → "Skill Match" (more accurate name)

---

## [1.9.13] — 2026-06-11

### Fixed
- **Contacts: concatenated text "Электронная почтаfoo@bar.com"** — `textContent` of `[data-qa="resume-contact-email"]` element contains label + email. Email is now extracted via regex from text or via `mailto:` href (clean email without label)
- **Contacts: phone was not parsed** — `[data-qa="resume-contact-phone"]` did not match actual hh.ru structure. Added: priority `tel:` href, extended data-qa selectors (`[data-qa*="contact-phone"]`), search for `a[href^="tel:"]` in contacts block, regex on block text
- **Contacts: false telegram @hh_ru_official** — regex `@(\w{4,})` captured the hh.ru link from the footer. Fixed: telegram is now searched only in the contacts block, system hh.ru accounts excluded (hh_ru_official, hhru, hh_ru, etc.)
- Both parsers synchronized: `parseContacts()` (live page) and `parseContactsFromDoc()` (fetch) use identical logic

### Changed
- **"Skill Analysis" block hidden until vacancies are available** — previously showed useless "0%" with text "open vacancies for comparison". Now the block is completely hidden until vacancies are loaded for comparison

---

## [1.9.12] — 2026-06-11

### Fixed
- **Contacts "Data not found"** — phone, email and telegram were not parsed when loading via fetch (sync all resumes). `parseContactsFromDoc()` was not called in `fetchAndParseResume()`, although it was called in `parseResume()` for the live page
- Added `parseContactsFromDoc()` to `resume-fetch-parse.js` — parsing contacts from fetched HTML with fallback strategies:
  - `data-qa` selectors (primary)
  - `mailto:` links
  - Regex patterns for phone and email
  - Search for `t.me/` links throughout the document
- Added `phone`, `email`, `telegram` fields to resume model in `fetchAndParseResume()`

---

## [1.9.11] — 2026-06-11

### Added
- **"All Resumes" block — collapsible accordion** — the block can now be collapsed/expanded by clicking the header (data-timeline toggle + chevron)
- Visible/hidden resume counters (badge) in accordion header

### Changed
- Block order: "All Resumes" is now on top, "Active Resume" — below
- Anti-monolith refactoring: split iframe-vis strategies, centralize panelState mutations
- Version: 1.9.10 → 1.9.11

---

## [1.9.10] — 2026-06-11

### Changed
- Anti-monolith refactoring: all files ≤200 lines, panelState centralised
- Split 6 monolith files, centralize chrome.storage
- Split main.js (454→139), events.js (301→209), centralize storage
- Updated submodules: anti-hallucination-guard (cascade-guard removed)

---

## [1.9.9] — 2026-06-11

### Fixed
- **Hidden resumes marked as visible** — three bugs in the visibility detection chain:
  1. **Premature UNKNOWN→VISIBLE fallback** in `extractVisibilityStatus()` and `parseResumeList()` — the resume list immediately marked UNKNOWN as VISIBLE without waiting for the detail page check. Removed: UNKNOWN stays UNKNOWN until the resume page is checked
  2. **Strategy 2 in `detectVisibilityFromResumePage()`** — `text.includes('скрыть')` matched any element ("скрыть контакты", "скрыть раздел", etc.), returning VISIBLE. Fixed: only exact match "скрыть резюме"
  3. **Resume page overrode list** — if the page returned VISIBLE (false positive), it overwrote the correct HIDDEN from the list. New priority logic: HIDDEN beats VISIBLE (both from list and page); VISIBLE beats UNKNOWN; final UNKNOWN→VISIBLE fallback only in `syncAllResumes()` after all checks
- Final UNKNOWN→VISIBLE fallback moved from `extractVisibilityStatus()` / `parseResumeList()` to `syncAllResumes()` — triggers only after both list and detail page have been checked

---

## [1.9.8] — 2026-06-11

### Added
- **Visibility detection from resume page** — `detectVisibilityFromResumePage()` in `resume-fetch-resume.js`:
  6 strategies for determining hidden/visible status from the resume detail page HTML:
  1. `data-qa` attributes (`resume-make-visible`, `resume-action-hide`)
  2. Button text ("Сделать видимым" = hidden, "Скрыть резюме" = visible)
  3. Body text with hidden indicators
  4. Raw HTML search with `&nbsp;` normalization
  5. Script/hydration JSON (`"hidden": true`)
  6. Presence of `data-qa="resume-action-hide"` = visible
- Data from the resume page **overrides** data from the list (more reliable)
- **Radio buttons in "All Resumes" list** — select active resume by clicking the card (◉ active, ○ inactive)
- **↻ (re-parse) button** on active resume card — contextual: amber for hidden, standard for visible
- **"Get from page" CTA** in "All Resumes" block — shown only on the resume page when there is no active one

### Changed
- **Button consolidation** — from 7 visible buttons to 2 main ones:
  - Removed "Re-parse active/hidden" — replaced by ↻ on the card
  - "Get from page" moved from empty state to "All Resumes"
  - "Synchronize all" became outline (secondary)
  - Diagnostics collapsed behind chevron (3 buttons hidden)
- **Dropdown selector removed** — replaced by radio buttons (eliminates accidental clicks)
- **Button rename** — "Make current active" → "Get from page" (eliminates "current" vs "active" confusion)
- **Block rename** — "Resume Parsing" → "Active Resume"
- Hidden resume warning — now text instead of button

### Fixed
- **`getResumePageType()` returned `'resume'` instead of `'resume-detail'`** — because of this, the hint "Click 'Get from page' below" and the CTA button were NEVER shown on the resume page. Both consumers (`render-resume-panel.js`, `render-my-resumes.js`) compared against `'resume-detail'`
- **detectVisibilityFromLinkText()** — no longer returns VISIBLE prematurely; returns UNKNOWN, allowing other strategies (card, proximity, script) to work
- **Final UNKNOWN→VISIBLE fallback** — added after ALL strategies in `resume-fetch-helpers.js` and `resume-detail/index.js`
- **Hidden resumes were not re-hidden** after re-hiding on hh.ru — fixed by detection from the resume page

---

## [1.9.7] — 2026-06-11

### Added
- **Loading spinners for buttons** — all 3 buttons (load-resume, sync-resumes, analyze-skills) show loading state with `btn-spinner` and restore after completion
- **`hh-ar-load-resume-done` event** — dispatched after resume loading completes for button restoration
- **`hh-ar-sync-done` event** — dispatched after synchronization completes for button restoration

### Changed
- Version: 1.9.6 → 1.9.7
- Popup version sync: v1.7.3 → v1.9.7
- README version sync: v1.8.3 → v1.9.7

---

## [1.9.6] — 2026-06-11

### Added
- **Strategy 5/6 sub-modules** — decomposition of strategy5-scanners.js and strategy6 sub-modules from monolithic files
- `resume-fetch-strategy5-scanners.js` — scanners for strategy 5 (DOM scanners for searching JSON in script tags)
- `resume-fetch-strategy6-urls.js` — API/URL fallback approaches for strategy 6
- `resume-fetch-strategy6-iframe.js` — hidden iframe (PRIMARY method of strategy 6)
- `resume-fetch-strategy6-expand.js` — expand orchestrator for strategy 6
- `resume-fetch-strategy6-api.js` — API-based fallback for strategy 6

### Fixed
- **Experience scroll & text truncation** — fixed text truncation and scrolling in the experience section
- Version: 1.9.5 → 1.9.6

---

### Fixed
- **Strategy 6: hidden iframe instead of AJAX** — diagnostics showed that the "Expand" button
  does NOT use AJAX. React/Magritte loads all experience data during client-side hydration,
  and the button simply toggles component visibility. Since full data is absent
  from SSR HTML and `<script>` tags, the only reliable way to get all records is to load
  the page in a hidden iframe, wait for React hydration, click "Expand" and parse the DOM.
  - New method `fetchExpandedExperienceViaIframe()` — PRIMARY approach in Strategy 6
  - New method `parseExperienceFromIframeDoc()` — DOM parsing from iframe
  - Existing approaches (API endpoints, query params) kept as fallback

### Changed
- **Anti-monolith refactoring of resume-fetch.js** — 1481-line file split into 8 modules:
  - `resume-fetch.js` (~45 lines) — thin orchestrator (imports + re-exports + syncAllResumes)
  - `resume-fetch-list.js` (~65 lines) — fetchResumeList()
  - `resume-fetch-resume.js` (~150 lines) — fetchAndParseResume() + header/skills parsers + experience orchestrator
  - `resume-fetch-experience.js` (~95 lines) — strategies 1-3 (DOM-based experience)
  - `resume-fetch-strategy4-text.js` (~145 lines) — strategy 4 (text search) + stripHtmlTags
  - `resume-fetch-strategy5-scripts.js` (~190 lines) — strategy 5 (script JSON)
  - `resume-fetch-strategy6-expand.js` (~370 lines) — strategy 6 (iframe, API, URL)
  - `resume-fetch-json-utils.js` (~130 lines) — JSON utilities (extractJsonArray, buildEntryFromApiItem, findExperienceInObject)
  - `resume-fetch-education-languages.js` (~50 lines) — education + languages + about me
- Public API unchanged: `fetchResumeList`, `fetchAndParseResume`, `syncAllResumes` are re-exported from resume-fetch.js
- Version: 1.9.4 → 1.9.5

---

## [1.9.4] — 2026-06-11

### Added
- **Loading spinner in panel** — when clicking "Load from current page" in `#res-parsed-data`
  a `.har-spinner` + text "Loading resume..." is shown instead of empty state
- **Strategy 6: extended experience parsing via AJAX/API** — new strategy for retrieving
  hidden experience records (3→6) that hh.ru loads lazily via "Show all":
  - (a) Search for "Show all" button URLs (href, data-url, data-action-url)
  - (b) Search for Magritte expansion URLs in `<script>` tags
  - (c) Try known API endpoints (`/applicant/api/v1/resumes/{id}`, `api.hh.ru/resumes/{id}`)
  - (d) Try expansion parameters (`?expand=all`, `?expand=experience`, `?showAll=true`)
  - (e) Parse JSON API responses (hh.ru API format: position, company, start/end dates)
  - (f) Parse expanded HTML documents (company-cards + stepper + text patterns)
- **JSON API parser** — `parseExperienceFromJson()` with recursive search for experience array
  in arbitrary JSON structure + `buildEntryFromApiItem()` for converting hh.ru API fields

### Fixed
- **Logger invisible in Chrome DevTools** — `console.debug` is hidden by default, replaced with
  `console.log` — now all `[HH-AR][ResumeFetch]` messages are visible without enabling Verbose

### Changed
- `parseExperienceFromDoc()` became `async` to support Strategy 6 (fetch requests)
- `fetchAndParseResume()` now `await parseExperienceFromDoc()`
- Version: 1.9.2 → 1.9.4

---

## [1.9.0] — 2026-06-11

### Added
- **Strategy 4: text-based experience parsing from HTML** — if data-qa parsing found few records,
  search for ALL date ranges (like "январь 2020 — настоящее время") in the experience section and
  extract surrounding text (position, company, description)
- **Strategy 5: experience parsing from Magritte JSON** — search for experience data in `<script>` tags
  (hydration state, `window.__INITIAL_STATE__`, `resumeStore`)
- **Diagnostic HTML dump** — first 2000 characters of experience section output to console
  for structure analysis during debugging

### Fixed
- Work experience: 5 parsing strategies instead of 3 (company-cards → stepper supplement →
  stepper fallback → text patterns → script JSON)

### Changed
- Version: 1.8.9 → 1.9.0

---

## [1.8.9] — 2026-06-11

### Fixed
- **Work experience: 3 → 6 records** — two root bugs:
  - Race condition in `initPageLogic()`: `expandHiddenSections()` was called without `await`, so `parseResume()` ran before hidden sections were expanded (3 visible cards instead of 6)
  - Stepper fallback in `parseExperienceFromDoc()` only triggered when `uniqueCards.length === 0` — if 3 company-cards were already found, remaining stepper-items were ignored
- **Stepper supplement in live DOM parser** — `parseExperience()` now also supplements records from stepper-items not covered by company-card wrappers
- **Noisy `checkAuth` logs** — removed 3 `console.log()` from `checkAuth()` that were spamming every 5 seconds

### Changed
- `parseExperienceFromDoc()` — 3 strategies: company-cards → stepper supplement → full stepper fallback
- `parseExperience()` (live DOM) — similar 3 strategies + company info search from parent elements
- Version: 1.8.8 → 1.8.9

---

## [1.8.8] — 2026-06-11

### Fixed
- **"Load from current page" on non-resume pages** — on the homepage (`/`) and `/applicant/resumes` the button now loads the first resume from `myResumes[]` or offers synchronization
- **Stepper fallback** — added to `parseExperienceFromDoc()` when zero company-cards are found
- **Debug logging** — preliminary count of company-cards, stepper-items and "Show all" buttons in fetched HTML

---

## [1.8.7] — 2026-06-11

### Fixed
- **Parsing on edit page** — `/resume/edit/{id}/about` does not contain `data-qa` attributes, now uses `fetchAndParseResume()` to load the view page
- **"Clear resume" button** — added `_resumeCleared` flag to prevent auto-restoration from `myResumes[0]`
- **Parse validation** — empty result (no title, skills, experience) does not overwrite good data
- **`initPageLogic()` made async** — to support `await fetchAndParseResume()`

---

## [1.8.5] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed
- **`parseSalaryConditions` ReferenceError** — function was not imported in `parse-resume.js`, call failed with ReferenceError
- Added import of `parseSalaryConditions` from `parse-resume-sections.js`

---

## [1.8.4] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed
- **Skill Gap UI wireframe compliance** — brought into compliance with the design mockup

---

## [1.7.3] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed
- **Pre-push hook**: fixed path resolution bug (`.git/hooks/..` instead of `.git/hooks/../..` — guard was silently disabled)
- **validate.sh whitelist**: added `check-agent.sh` and `audit.sh` to the allowed list
- **cascade-guard/setup.sh**: added execute permissions (`chmod +x`)
- **Git tracking**: removed 1052 skills/ files (system files, not part of project) from git index
- **Git tracking**: removed content.js.bak and content.js.map (build artifacts) from git index
- **.gitignore**: added global rules `*.bak`, `*.map`, `upload/`

### Added
- **cascade-guard submodule** — git submodule (https://github.com/stsgs1980/Cascade-guard.git)
  - cascade-cli.sh — task navigation CLI (next-task, start-task, complete-task, status, validate)
  - cascade-init.sh — interactive cascade-state.json generator
  - cascade-state.json — 35 tasks, 7 phases (P0-P6), single source of truth for statuses
  - AGENT_RULES.md — rules C-1..C-9 (dependencies, priorities, verification)
- **Git hooks**: pre-commit (blocks without fresh worklog) + pre-push (runs validate.sh)
- **worklog.md**: complete work log with Task IDs 1-22

### Changed
- **.gitmodules**: added cascade-guard submodule
- **AGENT_RULES.md**: merged AHG rules (1-6) + Cascade rules (C-1..C-9)
- Repository synced with origin/main (GitHub)

---

## [1.7.2] — 2026-06-10

### Added
- **6-tab UI wireframe** — complete panel redesign per wireframe
  - Overview, Resume, Vacancies, Negotiations, Settings, Statistics
  - Green accent theme (#059669/#10B981), glass-morphism, CSS animations
  - KPI ring, score ring, toggle switch, progress bar

### Fixed
- **FAB CSS isolation** — all styles via `style.setProperty(prop, value, 'important')`
  - hh.ru CSS no longer overrides FAB color

---

## [1.7.1] — 2026-06-10

### Added
- **Username display** — in header and auth badge when authorized
- **FAB tooltip** — for each authorization state

### Fixed
- **authIndicator badge** — click handler was dead, now works
- **renderSidebarContent null state** — fixed regex for spinner HTML

---

## [1.7.0] — 2026-06-10

### Added
- **Anti-monolith split** — all JS files split to <250 lines
  - parse.js (408) → 4 files
  - panel/index.js (277) → panel/ + events.js
  - Total 42 JS files, all <250 lines
- **TASK-CASCADE.md v4.0.0** — Phase 0 marked completed, Phase 0.5 added
- **Popup redirect** — minimal HTML redirect to FAB on icon click

### Changed
- Project renamed: HH-Auto-Respond → HH-Copilot

---

---

## [1.3.0] -- 2026-06-09

### Fixed
- **Critical bug: 8 of 11 resume fields were not parsed** on Magritte pages
  - Cause: selectors used CSS classes that Magritte hashes on each deploy
  - Result: gender, age, address, specialization, skills, experience, education, languages — all ✗
  - Only title, salary and skill-level-3 were found

### Rewritten
- **`parseResume()` — completely new parsing strategy (Magritte-safe)**:
  - **Auto-detection of sections** by h2/h3 heading text ("Опыт работы", "Образование", etc.)
  - Does not depend on specific `data-qa` or CSS classes — works with any Magritte version
  - Gender/age/address — parsing from text content near h1
  - Experience — search by `/employer/` links, b/strong tags, date patterns
  - Education — search by links and b/strong tags within the section
  - Skills — combined search: `data-qa="skills-table"` + heading "Навыки"
  - Languages — bloko-tag within section with heading "Языки"
- **`HH_SELECTORS`** — complete cleanup of Magritte-hashed CSS classes:
  - Removed: `.resume-block__title-text`, `.resume-block__salary`, `h1.bloko-header-section-1`,
    `h2.bloko-header-1`, `.applicant-resumes__resume`, `.resume-block-item`,
    `.vacancy-serp-item__compensation`, `.vacancy-description`, `.vacancy-response-popup`,
    `textarea.bloko-textarea`, `button.bloko-button_primary`, `.bloko-tag__section`
  - Removed from `parseResume()`: `.bloko-text_strong`, `.bloko-text`, `[class*="strong"]`,
    `[class*="description"]`, `[class*="experience"]` — all Magritte-hashed
  - Replaced with: `b, strong, p` + `data-qa` attributes (stable)
  - Internal experience/education selectors: `b/strong` instead of `.bloko-text_strong`

---

## [1.2.0] — 2026-06-09

### Fixed
- **Critical bug**: "Load from current page" button called `parseResume()`
  on the `/applicant/resumes` page (resume list), which always gave the error
  "Could not parse resume from current page", since `parseResume()` expects URL `/resume/{hash}`
- **Cause**: `hh-ar-load-resume` handler did not check the current page type

### Added
- **Context-dependent "Load" button logic**:
  - On `/resume/{hash}` — parses the specific resume (as before)
  - On `/applicant/resumes` — parses and displays the resume list
  - On other pages — warns that you need to navigate to the correct page
- **`getResumePageType()`** — determines page type by URL
- **`renderResumeListPanel()`** — renders resume list in sidebar
  - Clickable links to each resume (opens in new tab)
  - "loaded" badge for already loaded resumes
  - Hint for the user
- **Auto-save resume list** in `panelState.resumeList` when visiting `/applicant/resumes`
- **CSS for resume list**: `.har-resume-list-*` styles
- **"Open on hh.ru" button** in loaded resume card

### Changed
- `panelState` extended: added `resume`, `resumeList`, `activeTab`
- `renderResumePanel()` now checks for list presence and page type
  before showing placeholder

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-09

### Added
- **Resume parser** — full Magritte/Bloko DOM structure support
  - 30+ CSS selectors based on `data-qa` (stable, independent of deploy)
  - Parsing: position, salary, city, gender, age, specializations
  - Skills with level detection (Advanced / Intermediate / Beginner)
  - Work experience: company, position, period, description
  - Education: name, graduation year
  - Languages: name and proficiency level
  - Additional info (citizenship, relocation readiness, etc.)
- **"My Resume" tab** in sidebar
  - Display of all parsed data
  - Skill tags with color styling
  - Work experience list with positions and periods
  - "Load from current page" button
  - "Go to resume list" button (opens /applicant/resumes)
- **Auto-parsing** when opening a resume page (`/resume/{hash}`)
- **Resume saving** in `chrome.storage.local` between sessions
- **Debug panel** — collapsible block with results for each selector
  - ✓ found fields (green)
  - ✗ missing fields (red)
- **Tab system** in sidebar (Vacancies / My Resume)

### Changed
- `initPageLogic()` extended: handling of `/resume/{hash}` and `/applicant/resumes`

### Technical Details
- Magritte CSS classes with hashes (e.g., `magritte-card___bhGKz_8-5-13`) are NOT used
  due to instability. Only `data-qa` attributes and Bloko BEM classes.
- Skills are extracted only from the `[data-qa="skills-table"]` block
  to avoid capturing languages and tags from other sections.

---

## [1.0.0-hotfix] — 2026-06-09 (not released)

### Fixed
- **Critical bug**: `offsetParent === null` for `position:fixed` elements
  - hh.ru header is fixed, so `offsetParent` is always `null`
  - Result: authorization was NEVER detected (FAB always red)
  - Solution: replaced with `getComputedStyle().display/visibility` check
  - Affected: `checkAuth()`, `findElement()`, `waitForElement()`, `safeClick()`
- **Expanded authorization selector set**: 3 → 13 + cookie fallback
