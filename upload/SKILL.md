# Skill: Anti-Monolith v1.0

> ID: ZAI-ARCH-002
> Version: 1.0
> Last Updated: 2026-05

This skill enforces modular architecture by detecting and decomposing monolithic code. It activates automatically when size or complexity thresholds are exceeded, applying a systematic 7-step refactoring strategy to transform large, tangled files into small, composable, testable modules.

---

## AUTO-ACTIVATION RULES

**This skill MUST activate automatically whenever ANY of these conditions are detected during ANY task:**

| Condition | Threshold | Severity |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| File exceeds 250 lines | 250 lines | [C] Critical |
| Component exceeds 200 lines | 200 lines | [C] Critical |
| 3+ `useState` in one component | 3 hooks | [W] Warning |
| Upward layer imports (features -> sections) | 1 violation | [C] Critical |
| Mixed concerns in single file (data + UI + logic) | 2+ concerns | [W] Warning |
| Single function exceeds 50 lines | 50 lines | [I] Info |
| Component renders 4+ sub-sections inline | 4 sections | [W] Warning |
| `useEffect` with 3+ dependencies | 3 deps | [I] Info |

**Auto-trigger phrases (agent should recognize these patterns in ANY context):**
- Writing a file that goes past 250 lines
- Adding the 3rd `useState` to a component
- Importing from a higher layer
- A `page.tsx` that contains business logic
- A component that both fetches data AND renders UI

**The agent MUST NOT wait to be asked. When a threshold is crossed during ANY work, the agent MUST:**
1. STOP writing the monolith
2. Announce: `[ANTI-MONOLITH] Threshold exceeded: <reason>`
3. Apply the 7-step decomposition (see below)
4. Continue the task with decomposed modules

---

## When to Use This Skill

**MUST apply this skill when:**
- Writing a file that approaches or exceeds size limits
- A component accumulates too many hooks or concerns
- Layer boundaries are violated (upward imports, cross-concern access)
- User explicitly asks to "refactor", "split", "decompose", "modularize"
- Code review reveals monolithic patterns
- Starting a new file that will clearly exceed limits (plan decomposition upfront)

**DO NOT use for:**
- Configuration files (next.config.ts, tailwind.config.ts) — these are naturally long
- Auto-generated files (prisma schema, API types)
- Test files with many test cases
- CSS/utility files that are inherently flat

---

## The 7-Step Decomposition Strategy

When a monolith is detected, apply these steps in order:

### Step 1: Identify Sub-Components

Scan the monolith for JSX blocks that could be independent components:

```text
LOOK FOR:
- Sections of JSX wrapped in <div> with a clear visual boundary
- Repeated UI patterns (cards, list items, form sections)
- Blocks with their own conditional rendering
- Sections that could have their own loading/error states

EXTRACT:
- Each becomes a new file in sections/ or features/
- Props replace direct state access
- Component name describes WHAT it renders, not HOW
```

**Example:**
```tsx
// BEFORE: 200-line monolith page.tsx
export default function DashboardPage() {
  // ... 80 lines of state and handlers ...
  return (
    <div>
      {/* 40 lines: header with stats */}
      {/* 60 lines: chart section */}
      {/* 40 lines: recent activity table */}
    </div>
  )
}

// AFTER: 30-line composer
import { DashboardHeader } from './sections/dashboard-header'
import { DashboardChart } from './sections/dashboard-chart'
import { ActivityTable } from './sections/activity-table'

export default function DashboardPage() {
  const { stats, chartData, activity } = useDashboardData()
  return (
    <div>
      <DashboardHeader stats={stats} />
      <DashboardChart data={chartData} />
      <ActivityTable items={activity} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Step 2: Identify State Clusters

Group related `useState` calls and extract into custom hooks:

```text
LOOK FOR:
- 3+ useState in one component -> extract to use[Feature] hook
- useState pairs that always update together -> useReducer
- State that depends on other state -> derive with useMemo
- State for form handling -> extract to useFormValues hook

RULES:
- Max 2 useState per component (3rd = extract to hook)
- Related state must be in same hook
- Hook name starts with "use" and describes the domain
```

**Example:**
```tsx
// BEFORE: 5 useState in one component
const [name, setName] = useState('')
const [email, setEmail] = useState('')
const [errors, setErrors] = useState({})
const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false)
const [success, setSuccess] = useState(false)

// AFTER: extracted hook
function useContactForm() {
  // All 5 states live here
  return { name, email, errors, isSubmitting, success, submit, reset }
}

// Component uses clean hook
const form = useContactForm()
```

### Step 3: Identify Data Loading

Move data fetching to hooks or Server Components:

```text
LOOK FOR:
- useEffect with fetch/axios -> extract to SWR/React Query hook or Server Component
- Loading states tied to data fetching -> co-locate with data hook
- Error states for API calls -> co-locate with data hook
- Multiple useEffect for different data -> separate hooks

RULES:
- Client Components: use SWR or React Query hooks
- Server Components: fetch directly (no useEffect)
- Loading/error states belong with the data, not the UI
```

### Step 4: Classify Each Module

Determine where each extracted piece belongs:

```text
sections/ — Pure presentation, NO state:
  - DashboardHeader (receives stats as props)
  - DashboardChart (receives data as props)
  - ActivityTable (receives items as props)

features/ — Has state or business logic:
  - useDashboardData() (fetches + transforms data)
  - useContactForm() (form state + validation)
  - useNotifications() (real-time updates)

shared/ — Reusable across features:
  - StatCard (generic stat display)
  - DataChart (generic chart wrapper)
```

### Step 5: Add Dynamic Imports

For heavy dependencies that aren't needed on initial render:

```tsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

// Heavy chart library — load only when visible
const DashboardChart = dynamic(
  () => import('./sections/dashboard-chart').then(m => m.DashboardChart),
  { loading: () => <ChartSkeleton />, ssr: false }
)

// Editor — load on interaction
const CodeEditor = dynamic(
  () => import('./sections/code-editor').then(m => m.CodeEditor),
  { ssr: false }
)
```

**When to use dynamic imports:**
- Chart libraries (recharts, d3, chart.js)
- Code editors (monaco, codemirror)
- Media players
- Components below the fold
- Components behind interaction (modals, tabs)

### Step 6: Create Barrel Exports

Use explicit barrel exports for clean interfaces:

```tsx
// sections/index.ts — EXPLICIT exports (not export *)
export { DashboardHeader } from './dashboard-header'
export { DashboardChart } from './dashboard-chart'
export { ActivityTable } from './activity-table'
export { StatCard } from './stat-card'

// features/index.ts
export { useDashboardData } from './use-dashboard-data'
export { useContactForm } from './use-contact-form'
```

**Rules:**
- Use explicit exports for 10+ files in a directory
- `export *` is acceptable for < 10 files
- Barrel must be in `index.ts` at the directory root
- Consumers import from the barrel, not individual files

### Step 7: Verify Layer Separation

Run these checks after decomposition:

```text
LAYER RULES:
  app/        -> imports from features/, sections/, shared/
  features/   -> imports from sections/, shared/  (NEVER app/)
  sections/   -> imports from shared/ only        (NEVER features/ or app/)
  shared/     -> imports NOTHING from this project (only external libs)

VALIDATION:
  1. No upward imports (sections importing from features)
  2. No skip-level imports (sections importing from app)
  3. No circular dependencies
  4. Each file has a single responsibility
  5. Each component < 200 lines
  6. Each file < 250 lines
  7. Max 2 useState per component
```

**ESLint boundaries config** (add to project):
```js
// .eslintrc.js
rules: {
  'boundaries/element-types': [2, {
    default: 'allow',
    rules: [
      { from: 'sections', disallow: ['features', 'app'] },
      { from: 'shared', disallow: ['features', 'sections', 'app'] },
    ]
  }]
}
```

---

## Directory Structure After Decomposition

```text
app/dashboard/
  page.tsx              <- 30-50 line composer
  layout.tsx            <- Dashboard layout wrapper
  sections/
    dashboard-header.tsx   <- Pure UI, receives stats
    dashboard-chart.tsx    <- Pure UI, receives data
    activity-table.tsx     <- Pure UI, receives items
    stat-card.tsx          <- Shared reusable card
    index.ts               <- Barrel exports
  features/
    use-dashboard-data.ts  <- Data fetching hook
    use-contact-form.ts    <- Form logic hook
    index.ts               <- Barrel exports
  shared/
    format-date.ts         <- Shared utility
    constants.ts           <- Dashboard-specific constants
```

---

## Exception Handling

When decomposition is not practical:

1. **Document the exception** with a comment:
   ```tsx
   // [ANTI-MONOLITH EXCEPTION] Reason: Single-form wizard where
   // decomposition would break linear readability.
   // Tech Debt ticket: PROJ-123
   // Approved by: Tech Lead
   // Revisit date: 2026-Q3
   ```

2. **Exception is valid when:**
   - File is under 300 lines AND well-organized with clear sections
   - Decomposition would harm readability (linear flows, wizards)
   - Component is temporary/throwaway (prototype, demo)
   - Auto-generated code (Prisma client, OpenAPI types)

3. **Exception is NOT valid when:**
   - File exceeds 400 lines (no excuses, decompose)
   - Multiple developers need to edit the same file
   - Component has 5+ useState
   - Any test file for this component is also monolithic

## Companion Skills

| Companion Skill | When to Use | What It Covers |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| **fullstack-dev** | When decomposition requires new API routes or database changes | Backend architecture, API routes, Prisma schemas |
| **frontend-styling-expert** | When extracted components need polish or responsive adjustments | CSS, Tailwind, responsive, accessibility |
| **mermaid-diagrams** | When documenting the decomposed architecture | Architecture diagrams, dependency graphs |

## Quick Reference Card

```text
THRESHOLDS:
  File:     250 lines max (150 recommended)
  Component: 200 lines max (100 recommended)
  useState:  2 per component (3rd -> custom hook)
  Function:  50 lines max
  useEffect: 2 dependencies max (3+ -> refactor)

7 STEPS:
  1. Identify sub-components -> extract to sections/
  2. Identify state clusters -> extract to use[Feature] hooks
  3. Identify data loading -> Server Components or SWR hooks
  4. Classify: sections/ (no state) vs features/ (has state)
  5. Dynamic imports for heavy deps
  6. Barrel exports (explicit, not export *)
  7. Verify layer separation (no upward imports)

AUTO-ACTIVATE WHEN:
  - File crosses 250 lines
  - 3rd useState added
  - Upward import detected
  - Mixed concerns in one file
```

---

## Communication Style

This skill communicates in a direct, diagnostic style:
- Announce violations: `[ANTI-MONOLITH] File exceeds 250 lines (312 lines): decompose`
- Use severity tags: [C] Critical (must fix), [W] Warning (should fix), [I] Info (consider)
- Show before/after line counts: `DashboardPage: 312 lines -> 38 lines (composer) + 4 modules`
- No emoji — use text markers: [OK], [FAIL], [VIOLATION], [EXCEPTION]
